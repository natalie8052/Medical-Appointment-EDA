# Investigate Medical Appointment

## Project Objectives

**Project Title:** Analyze a dataset of 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil to identify reasons for patient no-shows and relationships between variables.


**Dataset Description:** This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

**Project Description:** In this project, I analyzed a large dataset of medical appointments in Brazil to understand the reasons for patient no-shows and to identify relationships between various variables. I used Python programming language to extract, clean, and transform the data, and performed various data analysis techniques, including statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## Questions for Analysis

1. What is the relationship between receiving SMS reminders and the likelihood of showing up for a medical appointment?

2. How do different health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and alcoholism affect the likelihood of showing up for a medical appointment?

3. Are there any particular neighborhoods or regions in Brazil that have a higher or lower rate of no-shows for medical appointments?

4. Is there a relationship between wait times and appointment attendance?

## Project Achievements

* Identified the top reasons for patient no-shows, including gender, age, SMS reminders, health conditions, neighborhoods.
* Provided healthcare providers with recommendations to reduce missed appointments, such as offering reminder services and improving access to flexible scheduling.

**Skills Utilized:** Python, data cleaning and transformation, statistical analysis, data visualization.
